 * \class assertion
 *
 * Exception notification class for Draco specific assertions.
 *
 * This class is derived from std::runtime_error.  In fact, this class
 * provides no significant change in functionality from std::runtime_error.
 * This class provides the following features in addition to those found in
 * std::runtime_error: 
 *
 * 1. rtt_dsxx::assertion does provide an alternate constructor that allows
 *    us to automatically insert file name and line location into error
 *    messages.  
 *
 * 2. It provides a specialized form of std::runtime_error.  This allows
 *    Draco code to handle Draco specific assertions differently from generic
 *    C++ or STL exceptions.  For example
 *
 * \code
 *    try
 *    {
 *       throw rtt_dsxx::assertion( "My error message." );
 *    } 
 *    catch ( rtt_dsxx::assertion &a ) 
 *    {
 *       // Catch Draco exceptions first.
 *       cout << a.what() << endl;
 *       exit(1);
 *    }
 *    catch ( std::runtime_error &e )
 *    { 
 *       // Catch general runtime_errors next
 *       cout << e.what() << endl;
 *    }
 *    catch ( ... )
 *    {
 *       // Catch everything else
 *        exit(1);
 *    }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note Assertion should always be thrown as objects on the stack and caught
 *       as references.

 * \subsection date11March2003 11 March 2003 (Kelly Thompson)
 * 
 * Major changes for class rtt_dsxx::assertion:
 *
 * Let rtt_dsxx::assertion derive from std::runtime_error.  G. Furnish
 * intended for the design to follow this model but the C++ compilers at time
 * did not have full support for \c <stdexcept>.  API is unchanged but the
 * guts of the class are significantly different (i.e.: use copy and
 * assignment operators from base class, use string instead of \c const \c
 * char \c *, etc.).
 *
 * \subsection date28July1997 28 July 1997
 *
 * Total rewrite of the ds++ Assertion facility.  In the old formulation,
 * Assert and Insist expanded into inline if statements, for which the body
 * were blocks which both contained output to cerr, and which threw an
 * exception.  This has proven problematic because it meant that \c Assert.hh
 * included \c iostream.h, and also because throw was inlined (not a problem
 * for Assert per se, since Assert was generally shut off for optimized codes,
 * but still a problem for Insist).  These effects combined to present
 * problems both at compile time and, possibly, at run time.
 *
 * The new formulation, motivated by suggestions from Arch Robison and Dave
 * Nystrom, uses a call to an out-of-line function to do the actual logging
 * and throwing of exceptions.  This permits removing \c iostream.h from the
 * inclusion graph for translation units including \c Assert.hh, and avoids
 * inlining of exception throwing code.  Moreover, it also allows us to get \c
 * __FILE__ into play, which we couldn't do before because there was no way to
 * do string concatenation with it, and you couldn't do free store management
 * effectively in an inlined macro.  By going out to a global function, we
 * pick up the ability to formulate a more complete picture of the error, and
 * provide some optimization capability (both compile time and run time).
 *
 * Note also that at this juncture, we go ahead and drop all support for
 * compilers which are incapable of compiling exception code.  From here
 * forward, exceptions are assumed to be available.  And thereby we do our
 * part to promote "standard C++".

 *
 * \section ddbc Using the Draco Design-by-Contract Macros
 *
 * The assertion macros are intended to be used for validating preconditions
 * which must be true in order for following code to be correct, etc.  For
 * example, 
 * 
 * \code 
 * Assert( x > 0. ); 
 * y = sqrt(x); 
 * \endcode
 * 
 * If the assertion fails, the code should just bomb.  Philosophically, it
 * should be used to feret out bugs in preceding code, making sure that prior
 * results are within reasonable bounds before proceeding to use those
 * results in further computation, etc.
 * 
 * These macros are provided to support the Design By Contract formalism.
 * The activation of each macro is keyed off a bit in the DBC macro which can 
 * be specified on the command line:
\verbatim
     Bit     DBC macro affected
     ---     ------------------
      0      Require
      1      Check
      2      Ensure, Remember
      3      (nothrow option)
\endverbatim
 * 
 * So for instance, \c -DDBC=7 turns them all on, \c -DDBC=0 turns them all
 * off, and \c -DDBC=1 turns on \c Require but turns off \c Check and \c
 * Ensure.  The default is to have them all enabled.  The fourth bit (3) can
 * be toggled on to disable the C++ thrown exception while keeping all of the
 * DBC checks and messages active. 
 *
 * The \c Insist macro is akin to the \c Assert macro, but it provides the
 * opportunity to specify an instructive message.  The idea here is that you
 * should use Insist for checking things which are more or less under user
 * control.  If the user makes a poor choice, we "insist" that it be
 * corrected, providing a corrective hint.
 * 
 * \note We provide a way to eliminate assertions, but not insistings.  The
 * idea is that \c Assert is used to perform sanity checks during program
 * development, which you might want to eliminate during production runs for
 * performance sake.  Insist is used for things which really really must be
 * true, such as "the file must've been opened", etc.  So, use \c Assert for
 * things which you want taken out of production codes (like, the check might
 * inhibit inlining or something like that), but use Insist for those things
 * you want checked even in a production code.
